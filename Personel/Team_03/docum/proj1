Proj1 Algorithm: Created Makefiles main.c , l_search.c , 

Algorithm main.c:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables and array with size 100
Step 3: Enter size of elements and read value
Step 4: Enter N elements for search and read by loop
Step 5: Enter a number to search
Step 6: Calling function with aruguments (l_Search)
Step 7: Condition if its true then it returns found key element
Step 7.1: else no element found
Step 8: Stop

Algorithm l_Search.c :

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare a variable
Step 3: loop that can Search an given element with an address and return to main.c
Step 4: return no element found
Step 5: Stop
